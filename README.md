#### SDLC Overview
"""
    This AI-powered workflow automates the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by guiding a requirement through various phases:

    1. **User Requirement** - Capturing the initial user requirement.
    2. **Product Owner Review** - Validating and refining the requirement.
    3. **Design Document** â€“ Developing a structured blueprint for implementation, with an option to **download it as a PDF**.
    4. **Code Generation** - Generating code based on the design, with an option to **download it as a .py file**.
    5. **Security Review** - Checking for vulnerabilities.
    6. **Test Cases** - Generating test cases to ensure functionality.
    7. **QA Review** - Verifying the final product before deployment.  

    Each step ensures the software meets quality, security, and functional requirements efficiently.
