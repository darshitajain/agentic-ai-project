# AutoFlow: AI-Assisted SDLC Workflow  

This AI-powered assistant automates and streamlines the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** by guiding software requirements through structured phases, ensuring **efficiency, security, and quality**.  

## SDLC Stages  

1. **User Requirement** – Capturing the initial requirement from the user.  
2. **Product Owner Review** – Validating and refining the requirement for feasibility.  
3. **Design Document** – Creating a structured blueprint for implementation (**Downloadable as a PDF**).  
4. **Code Generation** – Generating code based on the design (**Downloadable as a `.py` file**).  
5. **Security Review** – Performing vulnerability checks to ensure secure code.  
6. **Test Cases** – Auto-generating test cases for functionality validation.  
7. **QA Review** – Verifying the final product before deployment.  

## Why Use This AI-Assistant?  

- **Automated & Efficient** – Reduces manual effort across the SDLC.  
- **Downloadable Artifacts** – Provides structured documentation and generated code.
